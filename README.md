# scala-web-millbuild-spring-thyme-challenge-question-scrypt-encode

## Description
A springboot challenge-question web app with thymeleaf support.
Three roles are defined; USER, ADMIN, and SUPER. All roles
can access pages `/home`, `/login`, and `/about`. Only USER
can access `/user` and ADMIN only `/admin` whereas SUPER can
navigate to either and have its own `/super`. Each role
has an action USER=VIEW ONLY, ADMIN=READ/WRITE, SUPER=CREATE.
All password are encoded with scrypt.

Uses a challenge question on password rest and user register
to verify user. Customizes user data class by extending the
UserDetailService.
